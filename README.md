Up and Down Game

This is an exercise from my C classes on IEFP.

It was asked to the trainees to create a game with a menu and several other functions out of the main function, where the player tries to guess a random number between 1 and another integer number which can be selected from 3 different levels: 100, 1000 or 10000 and where we also have 3 levels of attempts: 10, 15 or 20.

I tried to validate all the inputs so that all the invalid inputs are rejected.

Enjoy the game!
